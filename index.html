                        Today was another day in quarantine. Felt like most other days since last Spring Quarter when I first returned home because of <i>COVID-19</i>. Beginning of Week 2. Good thing is that I'm excited for my classes this quarter. Lots of interesting things to learn. Worked on organizing schedule using Google Calendar. Thinking ahead to summer. Will I be able to get an internship? Frustrated with how some internships require experience. I'm here to gain experience!

                        Here's a screenshot of something I've been working on (it doesn't look as cool static).

                        Still quarantine? Yeah, I know, it's been a year. Here's a haiku about the experience:

                            <i>Trapped within these walls,</i>

                        Nevertheless, I've been trying to make my time staying at home worthwhile. I should be getting to used to it by now. Really miss in-person... everything. Want to go back to UCSD <em>ASAP</em>. Again, trying to make the most of each day. Think of what other humans have gone through in the past? Philosophy is useful and fun. Ideas are one of the best things about life (maybe that's a bit much, but then again, not really). Taking my final PHIL course this quarter. Going to miss them. Got a dose of software engineering from Professor Powell, makes me excited for what's to come.

                        Started the day with PHILosophy. Went to first discussion session of the quarter for PHIL 28. Somewhat disappointed in lack of enthusiasm and participation. To be expected though. Took first math quiz of the quarter. Missed a point because of a silly mistake, gets me every time. Had my resume critiqued by TBP officers, always glad to have feedback from others. Had a meeting with Professor Bucur and group for <i>TRELS</i> project. Project is coming along fine, really fun to be able to learn and apply software engineering (albeit very simply). It definitely isn't bad at all.
